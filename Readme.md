# Application tracker
### Desc
Used to track jobs I've applied to as a new grad. Stopped using it recently, but will potentially resume development when I have time to commit a significant amount of time to adding features.

Built using Tkinter, Python, and SQLite3. Very basic database file stored locally for user.

### Todo
1. Search and sort functions in Table page
2. Design colours n stuff
3. Data visualization, graphs etc
